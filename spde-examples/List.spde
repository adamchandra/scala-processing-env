/**
 * Array.
 * 
 * An array is a list of data. Each piece of data in an array 
 * is identified by an index number representing its position in 
 * the array. Arrays are zero based, which means that the first 
 * element in the array is [0], the second element is [1], and so on. 
 * In this example, an array named "coswav" is created and
 * filled with the cosine values. This data is displayed three 
 * separate ways on the screen.
